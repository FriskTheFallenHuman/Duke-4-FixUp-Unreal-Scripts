# The Duke Nuke Forever Unreal Script Project

### What's This
TL;DR: This repo aims to clean/fix up some decompile unreal script files.

Since DNF2K11 Recently got fully support and even to the point to where you can now change meshes i have think, why not create a small repo where I try to fix up some of the Unreal Script files?

## Usage
In order to use this repo, you need either: [DNF-reimposition](https://github.com/jmarshall23/DNF-reimposition) or [DNF-Enhanced](https://github.com/vini1264/DNF-Enhanced) to be able to use any compile .u files from this

## Contributing
Basically, anybody that knows UnrealScript is free to contribute to this, so feel free to help if you want. :)
